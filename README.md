# ⛽ Pit Stop

An incremental/idle game where you start with a small gas station and grow into a fuel empire.

## 🧠 Concept

- Start with **1 gas pump** generating passive income.
- Upgrade pumps to increase currency gain.
- Purchase additional pumps (each one costs more than the last).
- Operate a store for a second income stream.
- Remodel your station (soft reset) for long-term bonuses.
- Prestige (hard reset) for even greater permanent rewards.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `core/` — Game logic (income, upgrades, resets, saving).
- `cli/` — Command-line version for early development and balancing.
- `gui/` — Graphical version (Tkinter/Kivy/etc.).
- `assets/` — Images, sounds, and fonts.
- `data/` — Saves, configs, and balance tuning.
- `tests/` — Unit tests.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd /home/alex/pyProjects/psGame
python3 main.py
